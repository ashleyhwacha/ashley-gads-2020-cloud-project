#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

#LAB OBJECTIVES:
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.

#STEPS:

1.Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console

  gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --image=debian-9-stretch-v2019023 --subnet=default --tag=http-server

  gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW rules=tcp:80 --direction=Ingress --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0  --target-tags=http-server


2.Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
  2.1 choose a zone from the output of this command and use grep to filter the result:
        gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central-1

   gcloud config set compute/zone us-central-1b

   gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --image=debian-9-stretch-v2019023 --subnet=default      


3. Connect between Virtual Machine(VM) instances created above
  3.1.Use the ping command to connect my-vm-1 and my-vm-2 over a network:
   -connect to my-vm-2:
          
          gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

   -ping my-vm-1 from within my-vm-2
         
          ping -c 3 my-vm-1

   -Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:

          ssh my-vm-1

   -At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
         
          sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

   -Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
          
          sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

   -Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name
          
          Hi from YOUR_NAME

   -exit the nano text editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page.At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

          curl http://localhost/

         -Response : The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text


   -Exit the command prompt on my-vm-1 with the following command: 

          exit 
        
         -Response : You will return to the command prompt on my-vm-2


   -To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
          
          curl http://my-vm-1/

          -Response:
                 The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text

  3.2.Now get the external IP of my-vm-1 from this command :

         gcloud compute instances list         


 3.3.Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab
